# Design Pattern Change Study

Our design study centered around mobile phones. 
We plan to take surveys from people and have them list the phones they have and have had in the past in order to compile a list of popular phones. From that list we would decompile the phones we gathered and gather data from that list about the specifications and features those certain phones had. From this data, we can start making observations about what features were the most popular, were unpopular, were gamechangers, etc. during certain time periods.
