# Hackathon: Tinker

Tinker is a startup with an idea to build a "tinder" like service for matching
students who want to study together. The founders of the startup wants to choose a good web
framework to build this site. They want to base their decision on what's popular on Github.

The main question is: __What is popular on Github?__
