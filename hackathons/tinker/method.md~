# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* Which languages are most popular?
* Which repositories have the most forks?
* Which repositories have the most new watchers in a yearly quarter?
* Which repositories have the most stars?
* Which languages have the most total pushes?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.
